# Intro to Modern Web Development

A short talk that focuses on introducing the basic architecture of a modern web
application. We use a small Flask app as our example, and while there is a fair
amount of code shown, lots of it is greyed out or hidden, as the important bit
is the abstraction, not the code.

## Example

A working example is available in the example directory. If you want to run it:

1. Install Python for your platform, and easy_install if it did not come with
   your copy. There's [documentation available](http://python.org/doc/) if you
   need it.
2. Using easy_install (or pip, which you can install with easy_install) install
   the flask and sqlalchemy packages. Advanced users should consider using a
   [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) for this.
3. `python example.py`
